# Module 02: Updates 101

### Goal

Letâ€™s setup an internal testing workflow with EAS Update.

<!-- we'll want to save this change for Module 02, when we need something to publish a PR preview for -->
<!--
### Marking image

One more thing: let's add a watermark to the image. We can use the `react-native-image-marker` library for that.

We just need to add this part in the `crop()`:

```ts
const markedImage = await Marker.markText({
  backgroundImage: {
    src: image.path,
    scale: 1,
  },
  watermarkTexts: [
    {
      text: "#cma",
      position: {
        position: Position.bottomRight,
      },
      style: {
        color: "#fff",
        fontSize: 20,
        textBackgroundStyle: {
          type: TextBackgroundType.none,
          color: "#000",
          paddingX: 16,
          paddingY: 6,
        },
      },
    },
  ],
  quality: 100,
  filename: image.filename,
  saveFormat: ImageFormat.jpg,
});
```
-->
