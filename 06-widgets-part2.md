# Module 06: Widgets Part 2

### Goal
Letâ€™s expand on our widget to make something more realistic that actually shares data with our app.

### Concepts
- Adding native code to your app with a local Expo module
- Understanding how existing React Native libraries for widgets work, and why you may or may not want to use them.
- Sharing data with native features outside of your app
- Accepting parameters in config plugins

### Tasks
- Write data from your app to a file so the widget can read it
- Pick one platform to start (if you get done early, you can do the second one), and
    - Extend the config plugin as needed to support the added features
    - Style your widget
    - Read data into the widget
