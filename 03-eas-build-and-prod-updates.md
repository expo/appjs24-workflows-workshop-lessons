# Module 03: EAS Build and Production Updates

### Goal

Let‚Äôs setup an EAS Build workflow that can install our development and production build side-by-side and update our app in production without a new build via EAS Update.

### Concepts

- How CNG generates our native projects just in time based on project configuration.
- Using `eas.json` and `app.config.js` to generate multiple app variants
- Simulating EAS cloud builds locally
- Checking for updates when your app is open using `useUpdates`

### Tasks

- Convert to a dynamic config to change your bundle ID based on an environment variable.
- Gitignore your ios and android folders to return to a CNG setup.
- Generate `eas.json` to set that variable based on a build profile.
- Create a ‚Äúproduction‚Äù build using EAS build with `--local`
- Add a screen using the updates UI

### Resources

- [Install app variants on the same device](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/variants)
- [Run builds locally or on your own infrastructure](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/local-builds)

# Exercises

## Exercise 1. Get back to CNG and setup app variants

<!-- Gitignore native folders, delete native code, switch to dynamic config with app variants, test your app variants with `prebuild --clean` (use env variables inline with commands to simulate). -->

Run `eas build:configure`. It will create the `eas.json` file.

### .gitignore

From now on we will embrace the Continuous Native Generation (CNG) workflow. This means we will `.gitignore` the native folders and let EAS generate them for us.

```diff
storage/**

+/android
+/ios
```

### Dynamic config

We will also switch to dynamic app config. Let's rename `app.json` to `app.config.js`. If you are using VSCode, it's enough to add `export default` in the beginning of the file and it will get automatically transformed from JSON to a JS object on save.

Let;s differentiate between development and production builds by changing the app name.

```diff
+ const IS_DEV = process.env.APP_VARIANT === 'development';

export default {
+   name: IS_DEV ? "MyApp (Dev)" : "MyApp",
```

We should also update `eas.json` file to use the `APP_VARIANT` environment variable.

```diff
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
+       "env": {
+         "APP_VARIANT": "development"
+       }
```

## Exercise 2. EAS local build

We can use `eas build --profile development --local` to generate a local build.

TIP: You can use [Orbit](https://expo.dev/orbit), our tool for running builds on simulators and devices.

üèÉ **Try it.** Build app locally and run on your device.

## Exercise 3: Update your app

Test updates to your ‚Äúproduction-ish‚Äù app, use updates to add a ‚Äúversion info / about‚Äù screen that checks your app for updates and shows a refresh button.

Here's some code for this (still needs to be tested in a full updates scenario): https://github.com/keith-kurak/art-thing-2/pull/4/files
I ended up adding it to the visit page because I couldn't decide on where to link a whole different page.

# Bonus?

- Add semantic versioning with `extra`
  - See https://github.com/expo/UpdatesAPIDemo for how these could be used to deliver critical updates
- Add automatic app versioning (https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/app-versions/)
