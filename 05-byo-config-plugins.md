# Module 05: Build your own config plugins

### Goal
Let’s learn how config plugins modify native projects and let us tap into special native features by using one.

### Concepts
- Establish a good foundation for working with native features by walking through their configuration just like how any native develope would do it
- Config plugins are just doing automatically what native guides tell you to do manually

### Tasks
- Pick one platform to start (if you get done early, you can do the second one)
- Run Prebuild to generate the native project and walk through the configuration manually so you understand it. Save that work to a branch.
- Build a config plugin to create a basic “hello world” widget.
