# App.js 2024 - Expo Development and Distribution Workflows
Workshop exercises for App.js 2024 workshop.

## How to use this repo
1. Do the prerequisite setup steps below.
2. Clone this repo. You'll start working right on `main`.
3. Open up the **workshop** folder in this repo to see what to do. Start at module "01".
4. Do the modules.

# Prerequisites (do before workshop)
A Mac with Xcode and Android development tools is highly recommended. If you do not have a Mac, you will be able to do the Android exercises in the second half of the workshop, but not the iOS exercises.

## Installation/ setup steps
(adapted from https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
Bring your laptop! You will write code with it. If you regularly do JavaScript development, you likely have many of these installed on your machine already.

### Install Expo prerequisites
1. [Node.js LTS release](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 18 or higher)
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/). The [Github Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) installs this for you- that's what I use.
3. Recommended: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
4. Insert native setup steps (link to Expo doc)
4. Clone demo app template, including all branches (include screenshot of this) - I think it'd be good to make the demo a template repo, will likely make stuff like the Github setup easier.

## Verifying that everything is working
Something about running `npx expo run:ios|android`
